SMrandomTetrads
===============

SMrandomTetrads is a program written by many people, and has a history of almost ten years. The goal of this program is to simulate the 4-phasor random laser model, which is known to be a disordered spin glass system. Here we explain how to use this tool.

The arch parameter.
-------------------

The first important thing that needs to be set is the architecture of your NVIDIA GPU. The -arch option of the nvcc command must match both the architecture and your version of CUDA. Here are dropped some examples:

*   SM\_87, (from CUDA 11.4 onwards, introduced with PTX ISA 7.4 / Driver r470 and newer) for Jetson AGX Orin and Drive AGX Orin only

#### Lovelace (CUDA 11.8 and later)

*   SM\_89, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090, RTX 4080, RTX 6000, Tesla L40

Temperatures
------------

As is known, the critical temperature of the system depends on its size. This means that for each size, a range of temperatures should be chosen in order to make the transition to the glassy state visible. The maximum temperature for all sizes should be 1.6, while we report this table, which should be taken only as a rough reference, as based on the model's finishes (edge conditions, the way frequencies are distributed), they can also change significantly.

```
| size | t\_min |
| --- | --- |
| 18 | 0.40 |
| 32 | 0.45 |
| 48 | 0.50 |
| 62 | 0.55 |
| 76 | 0.70 |
| 96 | 0.80 |
| 120 | 0.80 |
| 150 | 0.85 |
```



Usage Guide for Analysis Class
==============================

This code is used to perform an analysis on a set of configurations and frequencies. It uses the following modules:

```python
import numpy as np
import os
import sys
import loadingModule 
import concurrent.futures as multithreading
```

The main class is called `Analysis`, and it should be initialized with the following parameters:

*   `param`: a list of 8 parameters that define the analysis
*   `path`: the path to the directory where the configurations and frequencies are stored

The `Analysis` class has the following methods:

*   `print_parameters()`: prints the parameters passed during initialization
*   `print_path()`: prints the path passed during initialization
*   `get_parameters()`: returns the parameters passed during initialization
*   `get_path()`: returns the path passed during initialization
*   `LoadWholeSample()`: loads all the configurations and stores them in the `configurations` attribute
*   `LoadFrequencies()`: loads the frequencies and stores them in the `frequencies` attribute
*   `print_frequencies()`: prints the frequencies
*   `print_config()`: prints the configurations

To use the code, create an instance of the `Analysis` class, passing the appropriate parameters and path, then call the appropriate methods to perform the analysis.

For example:

```scss
param = [10, 5, 0.1, 10000, 100, 100, 0, 100]
path = '/path/to/data'
analyzer = Analysis(param, path)
analyzer.LoadWholeSample()
analyzer.LoadFrequencies()
analyzer.print_frequencies()
```

This will initialize the analyzer with the given parameters and path, load the configurations and frequencies, and print the frequencies.
